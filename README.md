UIReview

UIReview is a lightweight sandbox repository for quickly prototyping and reviewing front-end implementations. It’s meant for testing small UI components, visual layouts, and design concepts without the overhead of a full build system or framework.

🧩 Purpose

This repository exists to:
Rapidly prototype HTML and CSS elements
Experiment with JavaScript interactions when needed
Share and review front-end ideas before integration into production environments
Think of it as a scratchpad for UI work—perfect for demos, mockups, and quick iteration cycles.
